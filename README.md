There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
<!--   > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand. -->
Note Taker Extension for Web Pages

## Sub-Heading ##
<!--   > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title. -->
The target audience is anyone who needs a way to keep track of specific parts of web pages they visit.

## Summary ##
<!--   > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good. -->
In today's society, it is virtually impossible to avoid using the internet whether it is for work, entertainment, or communicating with others across the globe. That being said, every web page is organized differently and it is often very difficult to keep track of them let alone specific parts of them manually. This product aims to simplify the process by allowing the user to highlight portions of web pages and save them to their account as they surf the web. Later on, the user can go to a summary page to view the saved notes or quickly scroll through the parts of webpages for them.

## Problem ##
<!--   > Describe the problem your product solves. -->
This product aims to make highlighting parts of web pages as well as keeping track of them easier--even if the user browses multiple pages that are unrelated to each other.

## Solution ##
<!--   > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem. -->
Once logged in, the user is able to easily surf the internet and highlight portions of the web page. At any point, he could either go to a summary page and review the highlights or quickly scroll through them with a simple click of a button.

## Quote from You ##
<!-- > A quote from a spokesperson in your company. -->
The internet has a ton of information on it so why not make it easier to keep track of?

## How to Get Started ##
<!--   > Describe how easy it is to get started. -->
Instructions: 1. Clone the repo 2. Run npm install 3. Turn on mongod 3. Change all the existing auth0 settings to your own 4. add your chrome extension id to your allowed callback on auth0 site 5. Run npm run build 6. Run npm start 7. Go to localhost:3003 8. Log in with auth0 9. View or delete all your bookmarks/highlights.

## Customer Quote ##
<!--   > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit. -->
Finally, there is a single application that can streamline the note taking process for web pages in an organized fashion.

## Closing and Call to Action ##
<!--   > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next. -->
Later on, the app will have more advanced features, such as a pen to draw on and mark up the notes.
